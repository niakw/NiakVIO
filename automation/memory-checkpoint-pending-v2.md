# NiakVIO checkpoint — Run 91 / portfolio sweep continuation

## Publication/finalization remains blocked
- `publicationAllowed=false`; target remains 5.21.40.
- Catalogue target is all 96 providers, not only currently green/active providers.
- Final publication still requires the exact candidate, 96-provider proof, the 5 Native Labs (TV Android, Mobile Android, Mobile iOS, Desktop macOS, Desktop Windows), player/UX/metadata/session/latency validation, security/docs/minimizer/fixed-point clean, and the four public manifests (`manifest.json`, `vf/manifest.json`, `no-anime/manifest.json`, `vf-no-anime/manifest.json`).
- Route discovery must stay live-proof-first: no invented routes and no validator-only success.

## Exact-source proof/LKG architecture now in place
- V21.5 fixed French-Manga catalogue identity: JJK S1 authoritative id is `1497198` rather than the unrelated global HTML id `1497822`.
- Exact-source live-positive route-proof LKG is implemented and persisted by a separate write-only job; provider execution itself remains `contents: read`.
- Same exact source SHA may retain previous positive reusable proof rows; a source SHA change resets them. `{id}`/`{slug}` rows require response-value correlation. LKG remains proof memory only, never publication authority.
- AnimeVOSTFR has an exact-source-only historical bootstrap for its pre-LKG `trembed`/Sibnet evidence.

## V21.6/V21.7 player fallback
- V21.6 preserves a failed proof-correlated player/embed hop as a bounded native-player fallback while still executing later branches.
- V21.7 adds private exact fallback provenance (`__nuvioCorrelatedPlayerFallbackV1`) and terminal sanitizer V7 consumes/strips only that narrow marker. Direct media remains fail-closed; ordinary catalogue/detail/API URLs are not promoted.
- Run 89/90 failures were pre-network test-harness issues (module path, then over-literal assertion), not provider results.
- Run 91 CI passed both real contract tests before network: `provider player fallback V21.7 tests passed` and `stream output correlated player fallback V7 tests passed`.

## Run 87 and first broad wave
- Run 87 (`34309729426`) was 3/3 for AnimeSama, AnimeVOSTFR and French-Manga; full non-network 96 guard passed.
- Run 88 first broad tranche had 10 upstream-positive pairs, 3 preserved (`animekai`, `french-manga`, `movies4u`) and 7 losses: AnimeSama, AnimeVOSTFR, AnimeZey movie+tv, Cineby movie+tv, MovieBlast movie. Dooflix was HTTP 429 and was not converted into a fake route.

## Run 91 exact result
- Run 91: `34311503094`, head `9388b705a1801ea9db828dd5a01c7b3c57618722`; LKG persistence advanced main to `5c3c21150c24b8d4aebd4054faa89e2b0a55ec88`.
- AnimeSama: exact value plan retained search -> episode -> Sibnet and targeted audit verified it.
- AnimeVOSTFR: not upstream-positive in that invocation; do not classify as a verified success or a NiakVIO loss from run 91.
- AnimeZey: upstream positive movie + TV but target lost both.
- Cineby: targeted audit lost movie+TV in this invocation, while the global census in the same run showed real 4/4 verified movie and 4/4 verified TV. Existing Cineby Wings/headers are already correct; this is intermittent CDN/network behavior, not a reason to invent routes/headers.
- MovieBlast: upstream movie positive but no reusable proof route; target correctly stayed fail-closed.
- LKG persist job succeeded. No later Provider Repair run was observed after run 91 at the time of this checkpoint.

## AnimeZey diagnosis
- Exact AIO source SHA: `46e83c8d710830679b7f17eacb03e014fc4195237cd423fe63254862549f24ff`.
- Upstream returned 1 movie stream and 2 TV streams on the positive fixtures.
- Positive calls use structured POST search values that current request proof cannot deterministically template: movie example `Interstellar.2014`; TV example `Breaking.Bad.S01E01` plus a redacted `page_token`.
- The movie request becomes non-reusable only because the current scalar placeholder logic understands whole-value `{query}` / `{year}` but not a deterministic composite query. This is a shared request-template capability gap, not an AnimeZey-specific rule.
- TV must remain fail-closed while `page_token` is redacted unless a live request proves a safe reproducible form without freezing a secret.
- Next generic fix: derive deterministic composite title/year and title/SxxExx request-body templates only when the observed value exactly decomposes into fixture-owned fields with no residue; add a shared runtime transform/placeholder and neutral contract tests.

## Cineby diagnosis
- Upstream still returns four streams for movie and TV.
- Global run-91 census successfully reached `api.speedracelight.com` seed/source endpoints and four `moon.peakstorm.top` HLS URLs, verified 4/4 with HTTP 200.
- Other targeted attempts saw the same CDN return 403. Keep retry/network classification separate from algorithmic reconstruction; do not fabricate headers.

## MovieBlast diagnosis
- Exact AIO source SHA: `d3b04a5ee1a13fed77192b5226d46001508fe321fa747f0c519d0c23d5b1a974`.
- Current upstream uses `https://app.cloud-mb.xyz`, static mobile headers, a path token for search/detail, and runtime HMAC-SHA256 signing of returned media URLs using the current Unix second and a source secret.
- Reconstructed stale generic `/api/search/...` routes return 404. Proof recovery correctly refuses to freeze redacted token/signature material, so `providers_proven=0` is expected rather than a false success.
- Do not hardcode TOKEN/SIGN_SECRET. A future solution must be a generic, safely representable signed/mobile request capability or remain fail-closed.

## Immediate continuation
1. Add the generic deterministic composite request-body template capability and tests, then live-retarget AnimeZey.
2. Independently advance the next deterministic 24-provider sweep so AnimeZey/MovieBlast do not block coverage of the remaining 96.
3. Re-test Cineby under the normal retry policy and distinguish transient CDN failures from reconstruction failures.
4. Keep MovieBlast isolated as signed-route architecture work; improve secret-free diagnostics rather than copying secrets.
5. Absorb this checkpoint into `MEMORY.md` and reset this pending file to `<!-- NIAKVIO_MEMORY_PENDING_EMPTY -->`.
