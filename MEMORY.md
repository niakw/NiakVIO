# NiakVIO — Recovery Memory

Last authoritative checkpoint: 2026-09-07 Europe/Paris.

This file is the durable recovery source of truth for the active NiakVIO work. Prefer current repository state and exact GitHub Actions/native logs over older chat summaries. Update this file automatically at every important correction, failure, publication, native proof, security proof, or architecture decision before moving to the next risky step.

## Repository topology / execution policy

- Repository: `niakw/NiakVIO`.
- **`main` is the only active write/publication target.** Do not recreate a persistent workbench branch.
- Durable Learning proposal branch: `brain-learning/proposals`; proposal storage only, not publication authority.
- Cleanup completed after 5.21.35 publication: `workbench` deleted, `hotfix/runtime-tmdb-credentialless-v28` deleted, PR #92 closed and never merged.
- Expected branches: `main` + `brain-learning/proposals` only.
- Catalogue target remains **all 96 Provider Objects**, including disabled/off rows for census/recoverability. Never shrink the catalogue to manufacture green metrics.
- A structural/materialization green is not real stream proof. Real route/network/yield/native evidence remains mandatory.
- Do not patch official NuvioTV/NuvioMobile/NuvioDesktop production behavior to make Labs green. Native Labs are observational.

## Accepted publication — 5.21.35

- Current accepted public generation remains **5.21.35** until a later checkpoint explicitly records a verified public 5.21.36.
- Final 5.21.35 publication commit: `9db07b3aa42ce2535ec1d7c19866beb43586badd` — `fix: restore Provider CONFIG in final publication 5.21.35`.
- Publication trigger commit: `96957c79403908028964aaab388bdb4c80a5bbe2`.
- Workflow `MAIN - Provider CONFIG Publication Hotfix`, run **34061529965**, job **101562800243**, completed success.
- Root `manifest.json`, `vf/manifest.json`, `no-anime/manifest.json`, and `vf-no-anime/manifest.json` were all verified as `5.21.35`.
- 96 provider versions/hashes were regenerated and Provider CONFIG validation passed 96/96.
- Temporary 5.21.35 publication workflow/script self-removed as intended.
- Flemmix authoritative domain is `flemmix.kim`; `.men` is stale. Commit `bdf11932ea5b949837c29b71c8a61b903e91c57b` fixed final DATA audit authority.

## Provider v3 architecture — invariant

Generated provider composition:
1. clean immutable/common ProviderBase v3;
2. structured provider DATA/CONFIG/static knowledge;
3. provider-owned `PROVIDER.*` Lego;
4. one global Core boundary;
5. shared `CORE.*` Lego;
6. conservative NiakVIO minimizer + content hash.

Hard rules:
- published/upstream/historical Provider JS is knowledge/reference only, never a reconstruction seed;
- **published Provider JS contains only common ProviderBase + structured DATA/CONFIG + managed Provider/Core Lego + envelope/minimizer-preserved structure**;
- no provider file/adapter may own duplicated identity, media-type, year, sanitizer, presentation, or other shared business rules;
- provider-local `strictIdentityScore`, `routeIdentity`, year rejection, or duplicated season/episode identity logic are architecture violations;
- ProviderBase may transport evidence and call shared Core services but must not own a second copy of Core policy;
- provider behavior belongs in DATA or owned Provider Lego;
- Core is provider-agnostic and each concern has one owner;
- managed Lego uses `STARTFIX` / `CLOSEFIX` (+ `FIXDATA` when needed);
- Provider Lego precedes Core boundary; Core Lego follows it;
- reverse reconstruction must be deterministic/byte-verifiable;
- Terser forbidden; production minimizer is `scripts/provider_v3_minimizer.py` and must preserve comments/markers/structure.

Core order:
`Provider -> STREAM_FACTS -> STREAM_IDENTITY -> MEDIA_TYPE -> STREAM_PRESENTATION -> PROVIDER_BRANDING -> SANITIZER`.

Ownership:
- `CORE.STREAM_IDENTITY.V1` is the **sole owner** of title/type/ID/year/season/episode identity acceptance semantics.
- `CORE.RUNTIME_MEDIA_SAFETY.V4` owns only playback/media safety: URL shape, P2P rejection, HLS/direct checks, bounded duration/playability. It must not own title/year/S/E collision policy.
- `engine_v2` may mirror Core policy for smoke/diagnostic tests, but provider-specific scoring APIs are forbidden.

## Identity / type / episodic-year contract — FINAL

- Provider input accepts **TMDB or IMDb**. Valid IMDb must not be rejected merely because TMDB enrichment is missing/unavailable.
- Episodic IMDb such as `tt11198330:3:1` preserves season/episode.
- Canonical semantic types: `movie`, `tv`, `anime`.
- Nuvio transport alias `series` maps to canonical `tv`; app-path tests cover movie/tv/series.
- Anime semantics remain distinct even when a provider uses a tv/movie transport lane.
- Capability/type gate must happen before provider network work.

Year policy:
- **MOVIE only**: title + type + movie year; year mismatch is strong evidence and may reject in strict mode.
- **TV / `series` / anime**: release/origin/season/episode year has **zero identity influence**, direct or indirect. No rejection, score promotion, `contentLike` promotion, or other heuristic may depend on year for episodic media.
- Episode resolution identity uses title/type + **season + episode**.
- Provider rows may expose original-series year, season year, episode year, or no year without affecting episodic acceptance.
- `House of the Dragon - Saison 3 (2026)` must be accepted against TMDB series origin 2022 when title/type/S3E1 are correct.

## Core identity 5.21.36 work — implemented source changes

Important commits after 5.21.35 include:
- `1723472`: ProviderBase runtime v9 migration introduced for episodic-year removal.
- `5b356ce`: `CORE.STREAM_IDENTITY.V1` shared catalogue identity API + movie-only year policy.
- `3600e8b`: ProviderBase delegates catalogue/HTML identity to `globalThis.__nuvioIdentityPolicyV1`.
- `491f1ba`: executable Core ownership regression for HOTD-like episodic year mismatch + strict movie year.
- `25e5148`: Workflow Gate includes identity ownership regression.
- `f62393a`, `fb76b5c`, `c1d8c43`: shared engine-v2 catalogue policy + Purstream HOTD S3E1 synthetic smoke.
- `398024c`: priority regression wording/contract changed to episodic-year-disabled/movie-only.
- `ef4073a`: ProviderBase provenance reports runtime reader v9.
- `a934df3`: one-shot Core identity ownership cleanup transaction.
- `c8bc366`: active-96 Provider JS Lego ownership test.
- `1d3a415`: identity-only ProviderBase materializer with `route_or_domain_mutation=false`.
- `d0824a8`: Kehflix-shaped final-row runtime regression: HOTD S03E01 survives, S03E02 rejects, movie year mismatch rejects.
- `9003a84`: MEMORY checkpoint recording the discovery that episodic year still indirectly influenced `contentLike()`.
- `c9e10ce`: migration strengthened to zero-year episodic identity v10; year cannot promote `contentLike()` for episodic requests.
- `8176123`: regression proves tv/series/anime produce the same decision with or without year.
- `a6f1b4bd`: authoritative retry workflow updated for v10.
- `ec8867c` + `7296e20`: Python test bootstraps fixed for direct Core Lego imports.
- `af73c025`: ownership test now inspects transformed ProviderBase snippets, not legacy source-anchor strings inside the migration tool.
- `c50806c`: Purstream contract accepts absent or empty `patch_scripts` as the same clean state; any non-empty legacy patch list remains forbidden.
- `05cce19c`: Purstream test aligned with real transport DATA: `published_types=[movie,tv]`, anime preserved semantically via `request_type_aliases={anime:tmdb_namespace}`.
- `e6ea30b`: Purstream recipe contract aligned with current DATA: `movieRoute=/stream/{id}`, `episodeRoute=/stream/{id}/episode?...`, `yearFields=[release_date]`; no `first_air_date` requirement for episodic identity.

## 5.21.36 publication attempts — exact state

**5.21.36 is NOT published at this checkpoint. Public manifest is still treated as 5.21.35.**

Workflow/run authority:
- Workflow: `MAIN - Core Identity Publication Retry 2`.
- Run: **34066073913**.

Earlier safe attempts:
- Run **34065556338**, job **101573573889**: failed before materialization because the one-shot Purstream migration expected one `strictIdentityScore(item, metadata, targetType)` occurrence but correctly found two (call + local definition). No publish.
- Retry run **34065727473**, job **101574024846**: cancelled/superseded before publication when zero-year v10 became authoritative.

Run 34066073913 progression:
- Initial job **101574939364**: migration and DATA scope passed; smoke failed only because `global_identity_policy_ownership_test.py` did not add `scripts/` to `sys.path`. No materialization/publish.
- Rerun job **101575336306**: bootstrap fixed; next failure was a test false-positive scanning `upgrade_provider_base_runtime_v5.py` source text and seeing the legacy validation literal `const movieIdentity...`. Runtime was not at fault. Fixed by inspecting only transformed ProviderBase snippets.
- Rerun job **101575867355**: **all smoke contracts passed**. Identity-only ProviderBase rematerialization itself passed **96/96**, then old Purstream contract failed because `patch_scripts` was omitted (`None`) rather than `[]`.
- Rerun job **101576053245**: all smoke contracts passed; ProviderBase rematerialization again passed **96/96**; old Purstream contract then failed because it expected `published_types=[movie,tv,anime]` instead of real `movie,tv` transport + semantic anime alias.
- Rerun job **101576310737**: all smoke contracts passed; ProviderBase rematerialization again passed **96/96**; old Purstream contract then failed because it expected historical `movieRoute=/media/{id}/sheet`. Current authoritative DATA says `/stream/{id}` and `yearFields=[release_date]`.

Repeated verified rematerialization line:
`IDENTITY_ONLY_PROVIDER_BASE_OK providers=96 unique_paths=96 common_digest=520ba9882661582dc4789f65e5d04c3c902fa22f79b1f436dc52823d845dd3fc runtime_reader=v9 route_or_domain_mutation=false`

Repeated smoke proof before the stale-contract blockers:
- global identity policy ownership: pass;
- Kehflix-shaped episodic identity runtime: pass;
- episodic zero-year regression: pass;
- engine-v2 Purstream adapter: pass;
- runtime media safety: pass;
- priority episodic-year-disabled/domain refresh regression: pass;
- native HLS integrity budget: pass;
- native provider loading compatibility: pass;
- global media resolver: pass;
- native dual IMDb/TMDB identity: pass;
- Provider v3 source plan v4 contract: pass.

The remaining transaction still must execute, on one successful run:
1. complete post-materialization Purstream contract;
2. recompose **all 96 active bundles** from common Base + existing DATA/CONFIG + Provider/Core Lego;
3. validate active-96 ownership and stream guards;
4. generate projections and synchronize release to **5.21.36**, bumping all 96 changed providers;
5. final reverse/static/ownership/integrity/fixed-point proof;
6. write final publication checkpoint to this file;
7. CAS-check `origin/main == base_sha` and atomically push publication;
8. verify public root/vf/no-anime/vf-no-anime manifests actually report 5.21.36 before telling the user to retest.

## Purstream current authoritative DATA relevant to this migration

- `published_types`: `movie`, `tv`.
- semantic anime request: capability alias `anime -> tmdb_namespace`, identity source `original_nuvio_request`.
- official site: `https://purstream.ad`.
- official API: `https://purstream.ad/api`.
- search route: `/search-bar/search/{query}`.
- movie stream route: `/stream/{id}`.
- episode stream route: `/stream/{id}/episode?season={season}&episode={episode}`.
- recipe `yearFields`: `release_date` only, used as movie catalogue evidence; episodic identity ignores year entirely.
- `strictIdentity=true`, `directSourcesOnly=true`.
- No provider-local identity algorithm is allowed; Core owns the semantics.

## Stream/player integrity

A URL or `#EXTM3U` response is not native playback proof. Keep separate:
1. extraction;
2. work/episode identity;
3. request context/headers;
4. playlist/variant resolution;
5. media/container integrity;
6. official native player outcome.

- `CORE.STREAM_SANITIZER.V6` is global and fail-closed on `probe_all_urls=true`.
- `tests/global_stream_output_guard_test.py` walks the 96 current manifest providers and requires one V6 managed sanitizer and terminal ordering.
- `tests/stream_output_sanitizer_fail_closed_test.py` executes fail-closed behavior.
- Historical Allwish ~20 s Interstellar result is a stream-level regression, not a reason to disable a provider. Allwish is not in current 5.21.35 manifest.
- Kehflix malformed MPEG-TS handling probes first media bytes when the runtime exposes them; lack of bridge byte access remains unknown rather than a fake provider-wide failure.
- HLS audio-child integrity `CORE.HLS_RUNTIME_INTEGRITY.V1` remains required.

## Five first-class Native Labs

Exactly five proofs:
1. TV Android — NuvioTV;
2. Mobile Android — NuvioMobile;
3. Mobile iOS — NuvioMobile;
4. Desktop macOS — NuvioDesktop;
5. Desktop Windows — NuvioDesktop.

Workflow mapping: Android matrix = TV + Mobile Android; Desktop matrix = macOS + Windows; iOS separate.

Runtime refs before final Labs:
- NuvioMobile audited/current: `68337ffac8578b986d0c3f6e432abf75f4a33521`.
- NuvioTV audited/current: `23d1fe478e380860dae3eb41c8770533361a0cc5`.
- NuvioDesktop last audited runtime-contract ref: `323c1037f3c0fbe0ebe255b77d42331c3fdeb2d7`.
- Desktop later advanced to `21aabeeb49fc6de835f9031a65cc5f8489419330`; compare showed player-shortcut/UI changes only, not provider/plugin runtime contract files.

## Security state

- Exact 5.21.35 publication SHA Default Setup CodeQL run: **34061759678**.
- Python analysis: success.
- GitHub Actions analysis: success.
- JavaScript/TypeScript was still pending at an older checkpoint; re-check final state rather than assuming.
- Final security completion also requires repository `SEC - CodeQL` / security-extended plus `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` on the final publication SHA.
- Direct code-scanning-alert enumeration is not exposed by current connector; never claim historical UI alerts were individually closed without evidence.
- Do not weaken CodeQL/security rules for green CI.

## Repository/documentation debts after runtime stabilization

Pending unless a later checkpoint says fixed:
- `CHANGELOG.md` was behind current release history.
- `VALIDATION.json` still carried stale release metadata.
- README EN/FR, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, and Domain Refresh docstring contained old official-site-only wording.
- `ARCHITECTURE.docx` must be regenerated/rechecked after final architecture wording.
- `.github/triggers/nuvio-client-lab.json` contained stale release/frozen route counters and should derive current truth instead.
- `automation/provider-v3-architecture.json` / ownership tests contained older branch-based publication assumptions; durable model is one workspace + CAS + atomic main commit.

## Domain Refresh — diagnosed, intentionally deferred until common runtime is stable

Current `refresh_authoritative_hub_domains.py` tries to reconcile terminal-domain derivatives, but the transaction has known inconsistencies:
1. scope validator/tests still encode old official-site-only mutation;
2. `update_provider_v3_domain_config.py` updates only `officialSite` instead of rebuilding full CONFIG from current structured source authority;
3. updater can emit old filename shape rather than source-qualified current publication shape;
4. generic old-host -> new-host logo/icon/favicon reconciliation still needs synthetic proof.

Required later fix: source authority + allowed scope gate + full CONFIG projection + source-qualified filename preservation + synthetic A->B tests + docs. ProviderBase/Core bytes must remain unchanged for domain-only updates.

## User Desktop HOTD S3E1 evidence on published 5.21.35

User supplied `nuvio-ux-20260907-001220.log`.

Observed chain:
- IMDb `tt11198330`, TMDB `94997`, type `series`, title `House of the Dragon` resolve correctly.
- Stream request reaches `type=series id=tt11198330:3:1`.
- `StreamsRepo Found 0 addons...` is ordinary addon-list state, not proof zero NiakVIO Provider JS ran; PluginRuntime network calls follow.
- Visible provider requests then include DNS failures for YFlix family, Nakios, Peachify and VidLink.
- Current priority is **not** a full route/domain sweep yet. First stabilize common TV/series/runtime architecture and already-viable providers such as Purstream/Kehflix; route census/repair across all 96 follows later.

## Active completion sequence

1. Finish 5.21.36 transaction through active 96-bundle recomposition, versioning, reverse/static/integrity and atomic publication.
2. Verify public 5.21.36 manifests and final active Provider JS ownership.
3. Have user re-test real Desktop HOTD S3E1; separate common-runtime results from route/network failures.
4. Stabilize any remaining common TV/series/player issues without narrowing provider scope.
5. Resume full real-route/domain recovery across **all 96**, testing routes live as they are discovered.
6. Fix Domain Refresh transaction defects.
7. Run complete five Native Labs on one exact final candidate SHA.
8. Finish Workflow Gate/security/dependency/CodeQL proof on final SHA.
9. Clean docs/machine architecture contracts/trigger metadata and regenerate `ARCHITECTURE.docx`.
10. Final branch/PR hygiene audit and final `MEMORY.md` checkpoint with exact SHA/run/artifact IDs.

## Completion principle

A green structural workflow is not proof that the 96 providers work. A native client failure is not automatically a provider failure. Keep identity, route/network, extraction, sanitizer, and player evidence separate; fix common NiakVIO-owned root causes at their owning layer; never delete providers, weaken validation, invent routes, or patch official clients to manufacture success.

## 2026-09-07 — Route reconstruction authority bug / proof-first redesign

- Critical architecture bug confirmed in `scripts/discover_candidates.py`: `infer_api_recipe()` can concatenate static route fragments (`search`, `stream`, `media`, `sheet`, `episode`) into executable `movieRoute`/`episodeRoute` templates without proving that the fragments form one real provider endpoint.
- `clean_provider_model()` also merges `patch.learned_routes`, `capability.routes`, and static `knowledge.routes` directly into executable `model.routes`; static observation therefore can leak into runtime Provider DATA before HTTP proof.
- `validate_provider_v3_routes_sequential.py` already contains the correct proof model in `derive_observed_route()`: start from an exact HTTP request observed while executing that provider, abstract only fixture values into placeholders, and refuse promotion when literal content/session/token residue remains.
- A second leak exists in sequential finalization: candidate `apiRecipe` is copied back to executable `apiRecipe` wholesale after route validation instead of filtering route fields by live proof.
- A third leak exists in `materialize_provider_v3_one.py`: `reconcile_provider_authority()` can copy `model.apiRecipe` back into `provider-overrides.api_recipe`, re-promoting stale/static recipe authority.
- `scripts/materialize_provider_v3_all.py::provider_model()` also merges static model routes/API recipe into the runtime model, so reconstruction must be changed to candidate-vs-executable separation.
- Final route model: **static/upstream/recognition data = candidate only; executable route/API recipe = provider-specific live HTTP proof only**. A route proof must preserve method, origin/base, route template, query/body fields, headers needed, semantic role/type, and evidence; static fragments never count as HTTP proof.
- `/stream/{id}` was NOT introduced by the current identity work. It was already in Purstream DATA on 5.21.35. Current Purstream engine adapter instead uses movie detail `/media/{id}/sheet` and episodic `/stream/{id}/episode?...`, exposing an existing route-authority inconsistency. Do not repair Purstream routes opportunistically inside the identity release; requalify them under the new proof-first route model.
- Next mandatory execution: patch reconstruction authority, reconcile all current routes to candidates, sequentially execute/requalify all 96 Provider Objects, persist only live-proven reusable routes, regenerate the 96 Provider v3 bundles from sanitized DATA, then run reverse/static/integrity proof before publication/testing.
