## TV runtime regression checkpoint — 2026-09-07

- User refreshed the current NiakVIO plugin on NuvioTV during route-proof work. Concrete native observation: Interstellar now returns streams from multiple providers; series/anime also return streams for some providers, but results can arrive much later after navigating away and appear to stack across works.
- This means series/anime are not globally broken. A major remaining systemic problem is stale provider work that keeps consuming the QuickJS/native fetch bridge after the user changes work.
- `CORE.MEDIA_TYPE_RESOLUTION.V1` currently has `requestSerial/requestToken` latest-result gating, but its `budgetedFetch()` is not bound to the invocation token. Superseded invocations can continue network/crawl work; because `global.fetch` is replaced by a later invocation wrapper, an older invocation may even execute later fetches under the newer request budget. Fix must be global/Core, never provider-specific.
- Required cancellation invariant: every provider invocation owns a request token; every wrapped fetch checks ownership before network and immediately after network; starting a newer invocation aborts the prior in-flight controller when supported; on runtimes where native bridge cancellation is not actually possible, the old in-flight call may finish but MUST NOT start any subsequent search/detail/player/crawl work or return output.
- Current platform contract says QuickJS clients expose AbortController/AbortSignal polyfills, but lifecycle teardown across already-entered native fetch remains not universally guaranteed. Therefore token gating remains mandatory even when abort is attempted.
- Native TV also exposed `Purstream - Inconnue` and `StreamZo - Inconnue`. Correct policy is NOT to discard quality blindly. `CORE.STREAM_FACTS`/`CORE.STREAM_PRESENTATION` must first recover a real quality from provider facts (`quality`, title/name/description, resolution/height, URL/manifest-derived facts). Only when no real quality can be recovered may the placeholder field (`Unknown`, `Inconnu`, `Inconnue`, `N/A`, null, etc.) be removed before terminal branding. Preserve real qualities such as 2160p/1080p/720p.
- Route-proof run #5 `34070914957`, job `101588047149`, materially progressed: migrations/proof-first tests/census/DATA apply/materialization reached green; candidate materialization was 96/96. The first failing post-materialization stage was prune/projection because `scripts/prune_unreferenced_providers.py` performs repeated per-file `git log --follow` calls while bootstrapping retention order and exceeded the bounded stage timeout. This is CI/tooling performance debt, not a provider runtime failure.
- Prune must be fixed by a batched Git-history scan/cache (single/bounded Git history traversal), preserving the rolling 10-generation retention semantics and all current/LKG/provenance/security protections; do not merely raise timeout.
- Final acceptance still requires rerun 96/96 -> reverse/static/integrity -> quick-yield -> real Purstream House of the Dragon TMDB 94997 S3E1 in both `series` and `tv`, plus the native-facing cancellation and quality regressions fixed.
