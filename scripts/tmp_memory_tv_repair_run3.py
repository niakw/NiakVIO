## TV shared-runtime repair run 3 — 2026-09-07

- `MAIN - TV Runtime Repair` run **34073127250**, job **101594076771**: all three migrations succeeded in workspace (latest-request cancellation, quality recovery, batched prune history).
- The new **functional cancellation regression passed**: observed calls were exactly `/1/one` then `/2/one`; the superseded request's catch/fallback `/1/two` never reached network. This directly proves latest-request-wins for the stale-fallback shape reported on NuvioTV.
- The run then failed before executing the quality behavior because `tests/stream_quality_recovery_tv_test.py` imported `global_stream_presentation_v1.py` without adding `scripts/` to `sys.path`, causing `ModuleNotFoundError: provider_patch_blocks`.
- This is a test bootstrap defect only. No Core repair was committed and no provider/manifest/public version changed. Fix the test import path and rerun the complete focused suite; do not alter the proven cancellation behavior.
